<p>Highwire Shakespeare offers free public performances of classic plays for busy New Yorkers. We prepare each production with a limited rehearsal of one week or less using the same process Shakespeare did. This makes our productions truly death-defying experiences!</p>

<p>We&#39;re in the process of organizing our premier production, and will release details on this website as soon as we know. </p>

<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

<p>Shakespeare and his actors had busy performance schedules, often doing six or more different shows in the same week. This meant actors had little time to prepare their roles.</p>

<p>So, much like a composer writes sheet music for musicians, Shakespeare wrote his scripts with all the cues his actors needed right there in the scripts. This allowed Shakespeare and his company to mount shows very quickly, with very little rehearsal.</p>

<p>At Highwire Shakespeare, we believe Shakespeare is like sheet music: when you know how to read all the notes, the whole thing comes alive!</p>
