<p>Highwire Shakespeare offers live and on demand performances of classic plays. We prepare each production with a limited rehearsal of one week or less using the same process Shakespeare did. This means our actors must think on their feet and improvise when necessary. Each performance is unique, and our productions are truly death-defying experiences!</p>

<p>We&#39;re in the process of organizing our premier production and will release details on this website as soon as we know. </p>

<h3>Why the short rehearsals?</h3>
<p>Shakespeare and his actors had busy performance schedules, often doing six or more different shows in the same week.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's actors also never received the full script. This was done to save time writing and to prevent theft of the story.</p>

<p>With only their own lines to work from, the actors had no idea how the scenes would play out until they actually performed it in front of a paying audience. This meant their acting choices had to be bold and deliberate.</p>

<p>Much like a composer writing sheet music for musicians, Shakespeare wrote his scripts with all the clues his actors needed right there in the text. This allowed Shakespeare and his company to mount shows very quickly with little rehearsal.</p>

<p>At Highwire Shakespeare, we believe <a href="http://badquartoproductions.blogspot.com/2014/04/trust-text-part-1.html">Shakespeare is like sheet music</a>: when you know how to read the notes, the whole thing comes alive!</p>

<h3>Why on demand?</h3>
<p>We think great classic theatre should be accessable to everyone, so we film our live stage productions in HD so you can download or stream them from anywhere.</p>
